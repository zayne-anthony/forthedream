			<Accordian title='Why did we create FortheDream?'>
				<p>
					Created in 2018, founders Danny, Shiv, and Gio started as a clothing
					brand due to the frustration of misrepresented. As first-generation
					Americans, success was only achieved through becoming a doctor,
					lawyer, or engineer. They wanted to defy this boundary to inspire
					others to conquer their own fears. Transitioning to web3, FortheDream
					wants to document their story and grow with others through this new
					form of community
				</p>
			</Accordian>
			<Accordian title='Who can come to the FortheDream hub?'>
				<p>
					The FTD hub will not be token-gated. However, some high-level events
					will be token-gated for holders only. Be on the lookout for some
					special experiences for the virtual and physical world
				</p>
			</Accordian>
			<Accordian title='What benefits do I get with this collection?'>
				<p>
					We have not released an official “roadmap” as we want YOU, the FTD
					holder to have a chance to vote on how we build in the future. Through
					Snapshot, we will have proposals on Clothing Brand drops, Events, and
					how to develop the IP of our brand with other products. We already
					have a ton of ideas
